A practical and technical repository focused on building systematic short-selling strategies using Python.
This project demonstrates how quantitative models, algorithmic workflows, and data-driven signals can be used to identify overvalued assets, generate short opportunities, and evaluate performance through robust backtesting.

🚀 Overview

Short selling requires deep market understanding, strong risk controls, and data-driven insights.
This repository translates those concepts into clean, reproducible Python implementations, including:

Alpha factor modeling for short signals

Feature engineering for overvaluation detection

Market microstructure insights

ML-based classification & prediction models

Risk management frameworks

Backtesting and performance analytics

Trade execution and position sizing logic

This repo is inspired by the principles taught in Algorithmic Short Selling with Python (2nd Edition) and expands them with practical, hands-on code.
